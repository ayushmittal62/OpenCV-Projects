# OpenCV Projects Collection

This repository contains a collection of computer vision projects implemented using OpenCV and various deep learning models. The projects range from object detection to counting tasks, all aimed at showcasing real-world applications of OpenCV.

## Projects in this Repository

### 1. **Car Counting using OpenCV and YOLO**

This project counts the number of cars in video streams and images using YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection and OpenCV for image processing.

- **Features**: Real-time car counting, video and image processing.
- **Tech Stack**: Python, OpenCV, YOLO (v3/v4).
- [More Details](./cars_count_using_opencv)

### 2. **Face Detection using OpenCV**

This project demonstrates face detection using OpenCVâ€™s pre-trained Haar Cascade Classifier. It detects faces in real-time via webcam or in static images.

- **Features**: Real-time face detection, image processing.
- **Tech Stack**: Python, OpenCV, Haar Cascade.
- [More Details](./face_detection)

### 3. **People Counting using OpenCV**

This project counts the number of people in video streams or static images using OpenCV and a deep learning model such as MobileNet SSD or YOLO.

- **Features**: Real-time people counting, video and image processing.
- **Tech Stack**: Python, OpenCV, MobileNet SSD or YOLO.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running any project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- `numpy`
- Pre-trained models (for specific projects like YOLO or MobileNet SSD)

You can install the required Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python imutils
