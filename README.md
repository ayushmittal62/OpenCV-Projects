# Car Counting using OpenCV and YOLO

This project is designed to count cars in a video stream or images using OpenCV for video/image processing and YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection. YOLO is one of the most efficient object detection algorithms, and with this project, you can accurately detect and count the number of cars in a given video or image feed.

## Features

- **Car Detection**: Detects and counts cars in real-time using YOLO v3 or v4.
- **Real-time Processing**: Works with both video streams and static images.
- **Scalability**: Can be extended to detect other objects using YOLO's pre-trained models or custom models.
- **Cross-platform**: Can run on any platform where OpenCV and YOLO are supported.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software and libraries installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- YOLOv3 or YOLOv4 weights and configuration files
- `numpy`
- `imutils`

### Installing Required Libraries

You can install the required Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python imutils
