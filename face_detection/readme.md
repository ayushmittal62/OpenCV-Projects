# Face Detection using OpenCV

This project demonstrates face detection using OpenCV's pre-trained Haar Cascade Classifiers. The system can detect faces in real-time from a webcam feed or from static images.

## Features

- **Real-time Face Detection**: Detects faces in real-time using a webcam.
- **Image Processing**: Detects faces in static images.
- **Cross-platform**: Can run on any platform where OpenCV is supported.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software and libraries installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- `numpy`

### Installing Required Libraries

You can install the required Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python
